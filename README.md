# XML_Project_JaxbParser

This is my project for manditory course XML Technologies at the university.<br/>
I'm using JABX xml parser to parse different xml files that have the relevant classes.<br/>
It is necessary for those classes to implement the JabxParsable interface that I'm providing. //No methods to implement.<br/>

From the GUI via radio buttons you have to choose the object type that you want to parse.<br/>
After that load some file from the Open button.<br/>
If it is the right file, you'll see it's parsed content in the text area.<br/>
Otherwise you'll get the corresponding error message. :) <br/>

There's also a Validate button, where you can validate your parsed object<br/>
with XSD Schema.
